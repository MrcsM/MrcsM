# Hello!
Hi! My name is Marcus Moquin, I am 19 years old and studying at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/). 

I am majoring in Computer Science.

I am currently (as of Winter 2022) working with [C++](https://isocpp.org/) and [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), while I have used [Python](https://www.python.org/), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) in my previous terms. Before university, my experience was in [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript), a basic language for Minecraft.

On my page, you'll find most of my class assignments, tutorials, and some of my personal projects.
 - I am currently not working on any personal projects at the moment.

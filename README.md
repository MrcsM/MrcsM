# Hello!
Hi! My name is Marcus Moquin, I am 18 years old and studying at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/). 

I am majoring in Computer Science.

I am currently learning [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), while my experience pre-start of University was in [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) for Minecraft.
#

On my page, you'll find most of my class assignments, tutorials, and some of my personal projects.

My most worked on personal project to date is [MCRoyale](https://twitter.com/MCRoyaleNetwork), a Minecraft version 1.16 Battle Royale coded in Skript. As of April 2021, the project has been recontinued after 1 year of hiatus, being coded in Java.

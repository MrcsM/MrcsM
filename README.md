# Hello!
Hi! My name is Marcus Moquin, I am 21 years old and studying at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/). 

I am majoring in Computer Science.

I am currently (as of Winter 2024) working with [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [C++](https://isocpp.org/), while I have used [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [C++](https://isocpp.org/), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) in my previous terms. Before university, my experience was in [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript), a basic language for Minecraft.
